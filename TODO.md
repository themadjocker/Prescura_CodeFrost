# TODO List for Separating About and Contact Pages

- [x] Create AboutPage.jsx in src/components/landing/
- [x] Create ContactPage.jsx in src/components/landing/
- [x] Modify CarePathLanding.jsx to remove about and contact sections, keep only hero and image gallery
- [x] Update App.jsx to add 'about' and 'contact' page states and handle navigation
- [x] Update navigation in CarePathLanding.jsx to navigate to pages instead of scrolling
- [x] Test navigation between pages (build successful, dev server running without errors)
- [x] Ensure no trickle references remain
